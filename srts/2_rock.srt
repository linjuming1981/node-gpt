1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,922
This is the people's show.

2
00:00:02,922 --> 00:00:06,781
[NOISE]
>> Speaker 2: And

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:10,577
you know what that means?

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,841
[NOISE]

5
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:14,939
[MUSIC]

6
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:24,939
[NOISE]

7
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,857
>> Speaker 3: You know
whose ring you're in?

8
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:30,787
[NOISE]
>> It's

9
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:34,098
been a long time, Rock, a long time.

10
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:37,496
But let me go ahead and tell you-
>> Speaker 4: You shut your bitch ass up.

11
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:47,397
[NOISE]

12
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:50,410
>> Speaker 1: You clearly don't know how

13
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,246
all this works.

14
00:04:52,246 --> 00:05:02,246
[NOISE]

15
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:21,276
>> Finally The Rock has come

16
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:24,422
back to Denver.

17
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:34,422
[NOISE]

18
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,391
>> Maybe I should try.

19
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:55,758
Finally, the ignorant people
get to see The Rock and

20
00:05:55,758 --> 00:06:01,960
Austin back in the ring
again one last time.

21
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,434
Only this time,
it's not boring old Stone Cold.

22
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,974
It's a real Austin, a real ass kicker.

23
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:15,535
The Austin that is gonna go on and
be so great.

24
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:19,390
I'm gonna be the entire Mount Rushmore.

25
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,080
Yeah, that's how great.

26
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,867
>> Speaker 2: Well, The Rock says-
>> It doesn't matter what The Rock says.

27
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,445
>> [LAUGH]

28
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:40,173
[NOISE]
>> Speaker 1: You see,

29
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:44,349
it actually does matter
what The Rock says.

30
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:48,047
[NOISE]
>> And it

31
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:52,980
actually does matter more importantly than
what The Rock says, what the people say.

32
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,884
[NOISE]
>> You bring up Stone Cold Steve Austin.

33
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,334
That's The Rock's, boy.

34
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:03,640
But if he were here right now,
this is what he would say.

35
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,818
If you wanna see me beat this
gibroni's ass, give me a hell yeah.

36
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:12,316
>> Hell, yeah.

37
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:15,882
>> So you see the roof just brew
off the place because we are live.

38
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,796
And as The Rock said, this is The Rock.

39
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:22,062
It's SmackDown and it's The Rock's
show and it matters what they say.

40
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:24,862
So you see how loud they just got, right?

41
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,221
So you wanna talk trash about Stone Cold,
talk trash about Pat,

42
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,954
talk trash about the people.

43
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:33,874
Well, The Rock says this,
you're Austin Theory, right?

44
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:34,958
>> Speaker 1: You're damn right.

45
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:42,208
>> Speaker 6: Right, right, right,
and you're from A town, is that right?

46
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:46,436
>> Speaker 1: You're damn right.

47
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:50,335
>> Speaker 1: Well, something else that
I'm damn right about is you clearly

48
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:51,372
are an A-hole.

49
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:55,615
[NOISE]
>> And

50
00:07:55,615 --> 00:08:00,458
I'm gonna show you, The Rock is
gonna show you, because we are live.

51
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,964
And here's how The Rock is gonna
show you you're such an A-hole.

52
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:09,580
You see, in about three seconds, this
side of the arena is gonna chant you are.

53
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,782
And then this side of
the arena is gonna chant.

54
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:19,726
[NOISE]
>> Speaker 1: Three, two, one.

55
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:23,019
>> Speaker 5: You are.

56
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:26,594
You are.

57
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:30,000
You are.

58
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,317
You are.

59
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:36,571
You are.

60
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:39,791
You are.

61
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,167
You are.

62
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:46,492
You are.

63
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:49,798
You are.

64
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:52,634
You are.

65
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,001
>> Speaker 3: So sorry,
hold on one second.

66
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:58,042
That was amazing, by the way,
Denver, Colorado.

67
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:01,941
[NOISE]
>> Speaker 6: That was amazing.

68
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,062
The Rock has got goosebumps right there.

69
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:04,830
But you know what?

70
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,678
This is The Rock show.

71
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,526
It's a people's show.

72
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,230
This is the people.

73
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,742
Now we're gonna give this side
a chance to say you are, and

74
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:12,330
this side a chance to say.

75
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,484
Three, two, one.

76
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,676
>> You are.

77
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:22,807
You are.

78
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:25,852
You are.

79
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:29,062
You are.

80
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:30,360
You are.

81
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,431
>> Speaker 7: Shut up your damn mouth,
be quiet.

82
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:40,495
Stop, I am not, no.

83
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:50,495
[NOISE]

84
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,305
>> Speaker 1: Two hours,

85
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:06,003
The Rock knows the show is two hours.

86
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:09,540
But right now, The Rock and
the people, we're having fun, baby.

87
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,557
[NOISE]
>> Here's a lesson for you.

88
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:18,326
The Rock doesn't know who you are,
but he knows what you are.

89
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,686
And clearly, you're a, but
let The Rock tell you this.

90
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:22,950
Let The Rock tell you this.

91
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,608
Your name is Austin Theory.

92
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:27,609
The Rock has a theory of his own,
and here's the thing.

93
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:30,736
You come out here on The Rock show,
the people's show, SmackDown.

94
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,680
You run down the people.

95
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,550
They're the reasons why
it makes it all happen.

96
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,478
The Rock says this.

97
00:10:36,478 --> 00:10:37,540
Here's The Rock's theory.

98
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,374
In about three seconds, The Rock is gonna
whoop your candy ass all over Denver.

99
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:50,151
[NOISE]
>> Speaker 5: Theory went after The Rock.

100
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:53,457
>> Speaker 2: How brave, how bold.

101
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:55,385
>> How stupid may that be?

102
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:59,206
>> Speaker 2: And went for
the spine buster, and here it comes.

103
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:00,486
Here it comes.

104
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,580
>> Speaker 2: Get out of there, Theory.

105
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,591
>> Speaker 2: Are you ready?

106
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:08,669
[NOISE]
>> It's been a long time.

107
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:18,669
[NOISE]

108
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,189
>> No, Theory's about to experience it,

109
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:39,550
the most electrifying move in all of
entertainment, the people's elbow.

110
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:48,774
[MUSIC]

111
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,960
>> Speaker 8: No, no, Rocky,
don't encourage this mouth breather.

112
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,766
>> Speaker 2: And
now McAfee with the opportunity.

113
00:11:54,766 --> 00:12:00,215
[NOISE]
>> Can

114
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:04,971
you imagine being in the ring and having
The Rock instruct you to do his own move?

115
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:08,680
>> Speaker 8: Sit down, I don't think
it's healthy to be upright at your age.

116
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,800
>> Speaker 2: McAfee
gonna deliver it as well.

117
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:18,272
McAfee taking his time,
into a People's elbow.

118

[MUSIC]

119
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:28,957
What a star studded night.

120
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:33,066
>> Speaker 2: Are you kidding me?

121
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,128
>> Speaker 4: I can tell from
experience that people elbow hurts.

122
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:39,766
[MUSIC]

123
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:44,000
