1
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,735
- All right, listen up, y'all.

2
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:05,471
I'm y'all's substitute teacher, Mr. Garvey.

3
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:09,375
I taught school for 20 years in the inner city,

4
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:11,544
so don't even think about messing with me.

5
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:13,179
Y'all feel me?

6
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,213
- Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:15,782
- Okay. Let's take roll here.

8
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:18,618
Jay Quellin.

9
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:23,356
Where's Jay Quellin at?

10
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,424
No Jay Quellin here?

11
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,227
Yeah.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,496
- Uh, do you mean "Jacqueline"?

13
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:31,764
- Okay.

14
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:33,566
So that's how it's gonna be.

15
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,268
Y'all wanna play.

16
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,403
Okay, then.

17
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:38,671
I got my eyes on you, Jay Quellin.

18
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:44,210
Balakay.

19
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,713
Where is Balakay at?

20
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,083
There's no Balakay here today?

21
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,519
Yes, sir.

22
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:54,554
- My name is Blake.

23
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,722
- Bl...

24
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:57,824
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

25
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,527
"Blake"! What?

26
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,562
Do you wanna go to war, Balakey?

27
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,863
- No.

28
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:05,465
- 'cause we could go to war. - No.

29
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,166
- I'm for real.

30
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:09,168
I'm for real.

31
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:10,470
So you better check yourself.

32
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:14,074
Dee-nice.

33
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,477
Is there a Dee-Nice?

34
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:23,450
If one of y'all says some silly-ass name...

35
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:28,454
This whole class is gonna feel my wrath.

36
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:29,856
Now, Dee-Nice.

37
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,257
- Do you mean "Denise"?

38
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:36,529
- You say your name right, right now.

39
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:37,630
- Denise? - You say it right.

40
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:38,664
- Denise. - Correctly.

41
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:39,699
- Denise. - Right.

42
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,300
- Denise. - Right.

43
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,302
- Dee-Nice? - That's better. Thank you.

44
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:45,705
Now, A.A. Ron.

45
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,608
Where are you?

46
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,176
Where is A.A. Ron right now?

47
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:54,180
No A. A. Ron, huh?

48
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,618
Well, you better be sick, dead or mute, A.A. Ron.

49
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,253
- Here! Oh, man.

50
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:03,656
- Why didn't you answer me the first time I said it, huh?

51
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,525
- Huh?

52
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,926
- You know, I'm just asking you. I said it, like, four times.

53
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,494
So, why didn't you say it

54
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:10,730
the first time I said, "A.A. Ron"?

55
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,268
- Because it's pronounced "Aaron".

56
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,703
- Son of a bitch!

57
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,740
You done messed up, A.A. Ron!

58
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,609
Now take your ass on down to Oh-Shag-Henessy's office,

59
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:25,578
right now, and tell him exactly what you did!

60
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,149
- Who? - Oh-Shag-Henessy!

61
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:31,951
- Principal O'Shaughnessy?

62
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,886
Get out of my goddamn classroom

63
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,222
before I break my foot off in your ass!

64
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,190
Insubordinate...

65
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:39,526
and churlish.

66
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:46,766
Tym-Oh-Thee.

67
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,234
- Present.

68
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,269
- Thank you.

69
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,538
- All right, we're gonna take a little roll here.

70
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:54,407
Jay-Kwelin. - Here.

71
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,644
- You are present? Ba-Lakay.

72
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,546
- Uh, here. - Uh-huh.

73
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,749
- De-Nice, Good. - Here.

74
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,486
- Je-Seeka. Thank you.

75
00:03:08,887 --> 00:03:09,622
- Mr. Garvey?

76
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:12,892
- What is it, A-Aron?

77
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:15,295
- Some of us need to leave a few minutes early today.

78
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,363
- Oh.

79
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,267
- Oh, is that so? - Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,804
- And what, pray tell...

81
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,441
is the reason for this premature exodus?

82
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:31,611
- Yearbook photos.

83
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,347
Um, we have to leave 15 minutes early

84
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,915
to meet up with our clubs.

85
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:38,351
- [chuckles]

86
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,885
All right, you know what?

87
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,288
That might work with other substitute teachers,

88
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:45,925
but I taught in the inner city for over 20 years.

89
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:49,495
Now, y'all wanna leave my class early,

90
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:51,664
so y'all can go meet up at the club.

91
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:57,403
Ain't none of y'all old enough to go to the damn club!

92
00:03:58,337 --> 00:03:59,539
Ridiculous.

93
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:03,376
- Mr. Garvey? - Dumb son of a bitch!

94
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:06,946
Did I st-st-st-st-st-stutter?

95
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,881
- Just then, yes.

96
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:11,851
- I'm gonna throw you out the goddamn window!

97
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:14,887
What, Jay-Kwelin?

98
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,722
- Mr. Garvey, we're... we're telling the truth.

99
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,024
We... We have clubs at the school.

100
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,959
We have clubs for special interests.

101
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:23,062
- Okay, I see. So y'all wanna play.

102
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:24,664
Y'all wanna play.

103
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,399
Yeah, okay, we gonna play little games.

104
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,301
Fine. I'll play.

105
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,770
I'm more than happy to play some games with y'all.

106
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,374
Anyone who's in a club, stand your ass up.

107
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,045
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, there it is, there it is.

108
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,980
The usual suspects.

109
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:44,417
What the hell club are you in, Jay-Kwelin?

110
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,018
- Future leaders of America.

111
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:47,820
- Okay, okay.

112
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,558
How would you know if you're gonna be a leader

113
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:53,859
in the future?

114
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,896
Is there a stargate in your bedroom?

115
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,332
Can you travel through time, Jay-Kwelin?

116
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,600
- No. - Then sit the flip down!

117
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,102
Ba-Lakay, l... Here's the thing.

118
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,738
I don't even know why I'm about to ask you this.

119
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,708
Ba-Lakay, what club are you in?

120
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,643
- I'm part of the Spanish club.

121
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:14,413
- Span... The Sp... You about as Spanish as Ree-On Seacrest,

122
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,549
with your big-ass Fraggle Rock hair!

123
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,618
How about you, De-Nice?

124
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:20,620
- I'm in the chess club.

125
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,557
- Uh, I'm sorry, sweetheart,

126
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,560
you are not in the chest club.

127
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,829
The mosquito bite club, maybe.

128
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,731
- Ah, that's hurtful. - Truthful.

129
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,468
There he is.

130
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,770
- A-Aron... - Hey.

131
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:41,006
- What club are you in?

132
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,541
- I'm the president of the glee club.

133
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:43,642
Why did I talk?

134
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:46,545
- The glee club? Aah!

135
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:48,614
Like they gonna have a club

136
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,517
dedicated to a TV show!

137
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,852
Take your ass,

138
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,854
to O-Shag-Hennessey's office right now,

139
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,923
before I bust a club up in your butt!

140
00:05:57,956 --> 00:05:59,792
- Okay. - Go!

141
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:01,594
- [crying] Okay, I'm gonna go.

142
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,028
- Mischievous and deceitful!

143
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:05,564
Chicanerous and deplorable.

144
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,600
- This is Principal O'Shaughnessy.

145
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,468
Students, please report to the gymnasium

146
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,603
for your club photos.

147
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,037
- Fake announcement.

148
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,574
Now, does anybody in here have a valid reason

149
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:16,976
for leaving this classroom?

150
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,444
T-Mothy.

151
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:19,111
- I gotta go pick up my daughter.

152
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:20,277
- You're excused.
